# Documentation

This document walks through the steps for downloading and processing the data from [\[3\]](#references), model learning with the `rom_operator_inference` Python package [\[4\]](#references), and postprocessing/visualizing results.

## File Summary

#### Utility Files

- [`config.py`](../config.py): Configuration file containing project directives for file and folder names, constants for the geometry and chemistry of the problem, plot customizations, and so forth.
- [`utils.py`](../utils.py): Utilities for logging and timing operations, loading and saving data, saving figures, and calculating ROM reconstruction errors.
- [`chemistry_conversions.py`](../chemistry_conversions.py): Chemistry-related data conversions.
- [`data_processing.py`](../data_processing.py): Tools for (un)lifting and (un)scaling data.

<!--

#### Main Files

- [`step1_unpack.py`](../step1_unpack.py): Read raw `.tar` archives and compile data into a single HDF5 file.
- [`step2_preprocess.py`](../step2_preprocess.py): Lift, scale, and project training data.
    - [`step2a_lift.py`](../step2a_lift.py): Lift and scale raw training data.
    - [`step2b_basis.py`](../step2b_basis.py): Compute reduced bases from the lifted, scaled training data.
    - [`step3c_project.py`](../step2c_project.py): Project lifted, scaled data onto low-dimensional subspaces.
- [`step3_train.py`](../step3_train.py): Learn ROMs from projected data via regularized Operator Inference.
- [`step4_analyze.py`](../step4_analyze.py): Use trained ROMs for prediction.
